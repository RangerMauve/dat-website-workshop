# Publishing your first Decentralized website with Dat

## Description

Decentralized and P2P technology has gotten really popular, but it's still mostly in the realm of nerds and cryptocurrency buffs. However, the distributed web is actually a lot easier to work with that you might expect. Dat is a P2P protocol that makes it easy to share and update files over a Peer To Peer network. What's more, people can create websites with it directly from a web browser.

This workshop will walk people through publishing their first P2P website using [Dat](https://dat.foundation/) and some retro-feeling HTML. Bring your laptop or phone and expect garrish colors, obnoxious GIFs, and the `<marquee>` element.

Length: 1 hour - 2 hour  
Language: english
Additional considerations: max participants TBD
